## Introduction
This repository contains source code for the assignments of Coursera's course, [Introduction to Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci), which ran between 01st May, 2013 to 26th June, 2013, i.e. for 8 weeks.
My hard disk crashed in the middle of the course and I lost almost all my exercises of the course, which were in a Coursera provided Ubuntu virtual image unfortunately. I could salvage and retain only 3 weeks of my assignments.
